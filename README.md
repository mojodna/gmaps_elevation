This is a project to show elevation as a heatmap layer on Google Maps.

Data for San Francisco is stored in text files.

Data can also be loaded live for anywhere in the world using the Google Maps Elevation API, but this is (1) slow and (2) subject to a limit on the total number of points requested.
